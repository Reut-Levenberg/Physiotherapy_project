## About The Project
Tracking and monitoring system for weight lifting training in physiotherapy treatments in collaboration with Beit Levinstein Medical Center.

The project includes weight sensors connected to a microcontroller with an embedded system 
and a control and management system as a web application. 
The wb application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS).
Designed with CSS and Bootstrap.
The communication between the two systems is carried out by a message broker in the MQTT protocol.

The embedded system sends the measurements from the weight sensors to the control and management system in real time. 
The web application integrates a user interface and allows the therapist to define the current training for the patient, 
view the graphs of the training data in real time according to the measurements received, 
view the summary of the current training and the previous trainings of his patients.
